-- | Combinators for a possibly-multidimensional measurement
--
-- The type @(Age, Height)@ is archetypal example of 'Measure'. It's typically
-- a fixed-length vector of non-negative " measurements ".
--
-- The anticipated use-cases involve some notion of a capacity that is limited
-- on a per-dimension basis. Thus the measure of each included candidate
-- quantifies how much of that capacity the candidate would occupy. See eg
-- 'splitAt'.
--
-- See the 'Measure' class for more.
