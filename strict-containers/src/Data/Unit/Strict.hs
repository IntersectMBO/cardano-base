-- | Force all of the elements of a 'Foldable' to weak head normal form.
--
-- In order to ensure that all of the elements of a 'Foldable' are strict, we
-- can simply 'foldMap' over it and 'seq' each value with '()'. However,
-- '()''s 'mappend' implementation is actually completely lazy: @_ <> _ = ()@
-- So, in order to work around this, we instead utilize this newly defined
-- 'StrictUnit' whose 'mappend' implementation is specifically strict.
